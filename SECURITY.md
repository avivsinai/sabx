# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
`sabx` follows semantic versioning. Security fixes will be backported to the latest minor release when feasible. Older releases may be patched on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Email `security@sabx.dev` with the subject `SECURITY: <short description>`.
- Include affected versions, reproduction steps, and any relevant logs.
- Expect an acknowledgement within 48 hours and an initial assessment within five business days.
- Disclosures remain private until a coordinated fix and advisory are published.

## Responsible Disclosure
Please do not open public GitHub issues for security reports. We greatly appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters in the release notes unless anonymity is requested.
