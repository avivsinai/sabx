# Smoke Fixtures

The files in this directory are generated by `go run ./tools/smoke`.
They capture sanitized JSON payloads for SABnzbd smoke tests so we can
add regression coverage in the future. Generated artifacts should be
reviewed before committing to ensure no instance-specific secrets are
leaked. The default output path is `testdata/smoke/latest`.
